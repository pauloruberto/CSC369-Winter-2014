Principles of Operating Systems

Taught by Karen Reid at UofT

Principles of operating systems. The operating system as a control program and as a resource allocator. The concept of a process and concurrency problems: synchronization, mutual exclusion, deadlock. Additional topics include memory management, file systems, process scheduling, threads, and protection.

In this course the assignments had to be implemented in C. This required a solid understanding of how the OS works including the every topic (and more) listed above.
